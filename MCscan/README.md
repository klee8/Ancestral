### MCscan identifies synteny blocks and graphs them

Aim:
1 Compare ancestral genomes from MLGO and progressive cactus
2 Look at structural changes between E.clarkii -> E.festucae Fl1  -> E.typhina var poae
3 Look at how E clarkii chr 2 maps to each of the other genomes and how these chrs evolve across the tree

Notes:
Make sure that input gff and genome.fna files have the same chromosome names
anchors and last files affect downstream analysis. Clean out these files for every iteration
E clarkii chr 2 seems to map to chrs 2-7 in E clarkii (may need to filter out these genes)
